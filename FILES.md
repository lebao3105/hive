## Folders:
Folders are also referred to as "directories".
- `./.github/`: Where the Github workflow files are stored.
- `./core/`: All the widgets and classes that `hive` uses. Most of the code can be found here.
- `./images/`: Screenshots of `hive`. This is used for showcasing the application in the `README.md` file.
- `./source/`: Resources that `hive` uses. This includes icons, images, fonts, and themes (as `.json` files).
- `./utility/`: Scripts for `hive`'s developers. This includes a Python script to build `hive` into a bundled application/

## Files:
- `./.gitignore`: Tells Git to not include specific files or directories when making commits.
- `./.pylintrc`: A file that configures `pylint` through available options. Some options include ignoring specific files.
- `./hive.py`: The main code/file. If you want to run `hive.py` from source, you'll want to run this file.
- `./requirements.txt`: A list of all of `hive`'s dependencies.
