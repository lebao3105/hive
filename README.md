## About:
`hive` is a file explorer for macOS. At its core, `hive` is pure Python and uses the `customtkinter` module. This project is meant to be a simple file explorer with a clean and modern UI. While it's not as good as Finder yet, `hive` is meant to be a replacement for the somewhat dull, complex Finder. Users will be able to do everything they can in Finder, just without the clutter and extra nonsense. `hive` is targeted at casual users. People who don't need to harvest the full power of the operating system and file system. 

By being open source, `hive` can establish a community of users that can help contribute to the project through code, documentation, and more. The community can look at the internal workings of this tool and find potential issues. Suggestions can be made and development sped up. Open source allows this project to have a much higher chance of surviving and not dying out.

## Platforms:
As stated, `hive` is a file explorer for macOS. This means Windows users won't be able to use `hive`. Linux users may be able to use `hive` but they are not an intended audience and there are no guarantees it will work. For Windows users, I would recommend [`Files`](https://github.com/files-community/Files) as an alternative. `Files` is another open-source file explorer but only for Windows.

## Images:
You can find screenshots of `hive` in the `./images` folder or [here](https://github.com/dishb/hive/tree/20da48fb7e18305743c7e491de8ad361a919d252/images).

## Customization
While `hive` already has many options for customizing the theme, you can still add your own themes and fonts! For themes, just drop the `.json` file into the `~/.hive/themes/` directory. For fonts, drop the `.ttf` file into the `~/.hive/fonts/` directory. In `hive`, you can select your new theme and font!
